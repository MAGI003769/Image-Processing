# Image Processing

This repo is a collection of  coursework code for my Y4 module EEE330 Image Processing. The tool used for this module is MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox. As Python also has a powerful capability as well. There will be some contents using Python after this module finishes if it is possible. 

# To-do

- [x] Lab 1: Image processing basic and MATLB Toolbox
- [x] Lab 2: Image enhancement
- [x] Lab 3: Image transform
- [x] Lab 4: Image compression
- [x] Lab 5: Morphological operations

# Notice

This repo is just my own implementations which are possibly not the optimal solutions. Some of them even have typical errors. Thus, you must have your own implementations for assignments. I was in the same lab with TAs of this module and they know the details of my code as we had discussions about them. Please don't take any chances on plagiarism. 

# Links

Here collects some links to several relative repos. Most of them, perhaps, are popular repos  on GitHub while some are the works from my schoolfellows.
